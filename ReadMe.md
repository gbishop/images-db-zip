# Experiments in packaging full designs for Project Open

I'm thinking about Zip files generated on the client. Storing images locally in
IndexedDb. How does all this work?

The first question I wanted to answer was can I _upload_ images and store them
in an IndexedDb, then package them as a Zip file along with some other stuff.

And the answer is **YES!**
